Eligibility to Participate/Registration with \u201cibidgames\u201d/Disqualification</p>\r\n\r\nBy placing a bid on ibidgames, the user declares that they are legally capable of entering into binding contracts and that they are at least 18 years old.\r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\nEmployees and relatives of employees of ibidgames are not eligible to participate in ibidgames auctions under any circumstances, but to ensure the normal functionallity of the plataform and can't win or keep any prizes whatsover.\r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\nibidgames\u2019s products and services are offered exclusively to private users and not to commercial or partly-commercial resellers. ibidgames reserves the right to exclude commercial resellers from the participation in the auctions and to close their user accounts at any time. Each user may register only once using their postal address (registration using PO Boxes or equivalents is not permitted). Additionally, up to three users registration per household is permitted. During the registration process, the user must choose a username. The username must not be offensive, be selected to deceive or mis-inform other users, may not offend common decency or infringe upon the rights of third parties. If ibidgames receives information of a username which is illegal or in breach of these Terms, this username can be amended by ibidgames without prior notice. The corresponding user password is to be kept secret by the user. User accounts created during registration are non-transferable. The user account may be used only by the user and not by anyone else.

In general, the user shall be liable for all activities that are undertaken using the user account together with the associated password.\r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\nibidgames reserves the right to temporarily or permanently disqualify a user, or disable their account at any time, and at its sole discretion. Users will be disqualified when in the reasonable opinion of ibidgames member has violated any laws or the rights of third parties.

In case of a breach of these Terms, ibidgames reserves the right to withhold deliveries or refunds for bids.\r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\nFurthermore, ibidgames reserves the right to limit the number of auctions a user may win or the number of his successfully finished auctions at its sole discretion. Please refer to our separate acceptable use policy for additional information.\r\n</br></br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>4. Bidding</p>\r\n\r\nBids can be placed by clicking on the relevant bid buttons.  The Auctioneer is a ibidgames team member who assists bidders if they have any questions. To ask an Auctioneer a question about bidding, you must communicate through our built in chat feature.  The user can read about how the Auctioneer operates in the \u201cHow It Works\u201d section. The user is prohibited from using bidding software not authorized by ibidgames, and doing so will result in immediate disqualification from use (see clause 2: Eligibility and the Acceptable Use Policy). \r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\n\r\n<p>5. How the Auctions Work</p>\r\n\r\nWith each bid placed, the price of the item on which the user is bidding increases by the amount specified (one penny). A bid submitted by the user constitutes willingness of a user to enter into a binding contract with ibidgames and in the event of a successful finishing of an auction, the claim to win the virtual item of the auction under the conditions set out in the related auction.\r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\n\r\n<p>10.
