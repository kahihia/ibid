This simple yet ground breaking idea is expressed not only though the system's evocative name, which is easily pronounced in a variety of languages, and suggests two players side by side, but also through its innovative list of features and extensive list of playable titles.\r\n\r\nA Little Box With Plenty of Power\r\nAs with every console, much of the buzz surrounds the specs. The Wii boasts 512 MB of internal flash memory, two USB 2.0 ports, and a slot for SD memory expansion. The system\u2019s technological heart -- a processing chip developed with IBM and code-named \"Broadway\" and a graphics chipset from ATI code-named \"Hollywood\" -- deliver stunning performance. And instead of a tray, Wii uses a single, self-loading media bay that plays both 12-centimeter optical discs used for the new system, as well as Nintendo GameCube discs.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary Control\r\nNo bigger than a small traditional remote control, the wireless Wii Remote is a truly multi functional device. The magic of the Wii Remote's design lies within; acellerometers inside the controller measure movement in all directions and at all speeds. In a tennis game, it serves as your racket as you swing away. In driving games it serves as a steering wheel, allowing you to swerve to avoid obstacles or pickup power-ups. In first-person shooters, it acts as a firearm that you can point directly at an on-screen enemy. The controller also has a force feedback \"Rumble\" feature and an expansion port for use with accessories, such as the Nunchuck, which adds an analog thumbstick and trigger buttons. The system allows for up to four controllers to be linked at a time and utilizes standard Bluetooth wireless technology. For those who prefer the feel of a traditional controller an adapter is available that fits over the Wii's remote.\r\n\r\n", "name": "WII", "slug": "wii"}}, {"pk": 8, "model": "bidding.item", "fields": {"retail_price": "539.99", "description": "Introducing Xbox 360 Elite, the premier Xbox 360 console package that includes a massive 120GB hard drive, a HDMI port, and HDMI cable, all wrapped up with a premium black finish.

The DeFIBulator is destined to be the most talked about new novelty product this year. After extensive research and development in labs in Singapore, Spion has developed the first generation of the DeFIBulator hand-held voice tension detector. The DeFIBulator was shown to have a very high accuracy rate. Can also Connect to Your Cell Phone for Direct Digital Connection The DeFIBulator utilizes voice tension technology to measure varying degrees of vibration in the voice. These vibrations are caused by the user going from a state of calm, to being a little nervous as you would when you lie.

Because of the digital connection, it will actually be much more accurate.

Heck, we even sell a fine one here at ThinkGeek. But, we're pretty sure you want to be a superior geek - and doing it with a green laser is the way to go. This pointer is significantly brighter (about 50 times) than a red laser pointer and because of its unusual color it is much more noticeable. I mean come on, a 532 nm green laser wavelength is obviously superior to a laughable 650 nm red laser wavelength. And unlike a red laser, the green beam itself can be seen in mid-air in dark conditions, not just the laser beam dot. This allows the green laser pointer to be used for pointing to star constellations (skypointing) and also just generally look cool as hell. The green laser beam dot can be seen at much greater distances than with a red laser pointer. Since green direct injection laser diodes aren't readily available, this pointer is based on the use of Diode Pumped Solid State Frequency Doubled (DPSSFD) laser technology. A high power IR laser diode at 808 nm pumps a tiny block of Nd:YVO4 generating light at 1,064 nm which feeds a KTP intracavity frequency doubler crystal to produce the green beam at 532 nm. Features of this unit include: Very bright green laser at 532 nm wavelength Output power of <5mW (Class IIIa Laser Product) Range of approximately 9,000 ft (2600 m) in darkness 1.1 mm beam diameter at source Momentary push button switch Solid, heavy duty construction Constant wave out.", "name": "Green Laser Pointer II", "slug": "green-laser-pointer-ii"}}, {"pk": 16, "model": "bidding.item", "fields": {"retail_price": "150.00", "description": " 20mw 532nm Astronomy Powerful.\r\n\r\nBlack Dimple Finish High Power Green Laser.

Newcomers to the hobby are always surprised at how large amateur telescopes are, but to experienced observers, this XT4.5 is considered a very small scope. Tiny, in fact (It\u2019s so small, astronomers are buying them just because they think they're so cute). Make no mistake, though--the XT4.5 is a full-fledged telescope, and is a serious observing tool that could last you for years. \r\n\r\nYour money buys you a lot in this case. Included are a good-quality 4.5\" f/8 primary mirror, two eyepieces, a finder, and a CD-ROM with a stripped-down version of The Sky, a software guide to the sky. The scope comes in two cartons. One contains the optical tube, and the other is a flat-packed box containing the base, which you assemble yourself. Orion includes all the hardware and tools you need, and the instructions are well written. Allocate about 30 minutes to assemble and align everything. \r\n \r\nSee a detailed view of \r\nthe XT4.5's features \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of cost-cutting measures. The primary mirror is spherical, not parabolic (this is not likely to affect the views, however). Also, the focuser is plastic. While I\u2019ve never seen one break, plastic focusers are by nature less robust than metal ones. Finally (and this may be the most serious concern of all), the scope is a little short for an adult. The eyepiece is only 3 feet off the ground, which may force you to stoop over (hint: try sitting on a short chair or stool while observing). On the other hand, the height is ideal for a child, and as a result, I heartily recommend this telescope for children. \r\n\r\nUnder the stars, the XT4.5 exhibits excellent performance. Once properly collimated (aligned), the optics give clear, sharp, contrasty views. I\u2019ve spent enjoyable nights using these telescopes, both as a teaching tool and by myself. Jupiter\u2019s cloud band and four moons are no problem to see, nor are Saturn\u2019s rings. The Orion Nebula is a glowing fan of green gas, with a quartet of tiny stars at its core. Under dark skies (and with some diligence) the XT4.5 can even pull in some of the fainter deep sky objects, like the brighter galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that I have a garage full of expensive telescopes, I never feel compromised with any of Orion\u2019s XT scopes.

With this Bakugan Battle Pack, kids 4 and above will enjoy the challenge of earning points by rolling their Bakugan (or shooting them from a launcher) onto magnetic cards where the plastic spheres burst open to reveal the fearsome warrior apparatus inside. Kids will also love the way the Bakugan transform suddenly into warrior mode, and fans of the show will have an especially good time with the game.\r\n\r\n Ready, Set, Play!\r\nThe mission of Bakugan game play is to battle against other Bakugan to win the points awarded on the cards by getting your Bakugan to land on card. Players will love pretending to be one of the various characters in the show, such as the fiery 12-year-old leader \"Dan\" or the wise \"Marucho,\" and they gain a deeper understanding of the cards and warriors as they play.\r\n\r\nThe Battle Pack includes instructions, making it an ideal way for newbies to get started with this fun and exciting game. The game itself is fairly straightforward, but if your child has never played before, you might have to help him or her to understand the rules -- after reading and understanding them yourself. While some of the plastic Bakugan pieces are small and could easily get lost, others, like the Bakugan Deka, are as big as a softball.\r\n\r\nIf your child is already a Bakugan fan, the Battle Pack is a good investment. This set comes with six randomly selected Bakugan and eight magnetic cards. Your child will love how this set dramatically increases their collection of Bakugan! He or she can also use the Battle Pack to play with his friends who might not have any Bakugan of their own.\r\n\r\nExciting Magnetic Action\r\nThe Bakugan come in lots of colors and varieties that make them fun to collect and trade. Most of them are pocket-sized and easy for your child to carry around and bring over to their friend's houses. Having a magnet that activates the warriors is a clever idea that adds excitement to the game. The Bakugan Launcher (sold separately) is a great accessory, with three shooting modes (\"curve,\" \"angle, and \"distance\"), but it doesn't come with any instructions.\r\n\r\nRoom for the Imagination\r\nWe like that this that this game combines skill (aiming your Bakugan) with strategy (placement of the cards). We also enjoyed the way the warriors pop open on the magnetic cards -- although sometimes they do it even when they don't land on the cards. Being unfamiliar with the TV show, we felt a little lost at first in the world of Bakugan. But with the help of the colorful, animated Bakugan Web site, we got the gist of what the game is about and how to play. Our attempts to fire the launcher proved somewhat difficult and instructions would have helped. But the launcher isn't necessary. Kids can simply roll the Bakugan like marbles for a fun and action-packed game with their friends.\r\n\r\nWhat's in the Box\r\nSix Bakugan, eight metal cards, and instructions.\r\n\r\nProduct Description\r\n\r\nThis Bakugan Battlepack Teal and Red Set has small spheres that magnetically morph into powerful Bakugan warriors when they roll onto the real metal gate cards. Use strategy to place your metal gate cards effectively as each cards affects the battle differently. Then master you precision shooting skills to roll your Bakugan into battle and win.", "name": "Bakugan", "slug": "bakugan"}}, {"pk": 84, "model": "bidding.item", "fields": {"retail_price": "2000.00", "description": "Prada Hangbag", "name": "Prada Hangbag", "slug": "Pradahangbag"}}, {"pk": 86, "model": "bidding.item", "fields": {"retail_price": "229.99", "description": "Technical Details\r\nGPS system preloaded with City Navigator North America NT \r\n4.3-inch touchscreen display with 2D/3D mapping perspective \r\nTurn-by-turn directions with voice guidance and text to speech \r\nRechargeable lithium-ion battery makes it convenient for navigation by car or foot \r\nIncludes JPEG picture viewer, world travel clock with time zones, currency converter, measurement converter, calculator and more ", "name": "Garmin Nuvi", "slug": "Garmin"}}, {"pk": 83, "model": "bidding.item", "fields": {"retail_price": "15000.00", "description": "Rolex original", "name": "Rolex", "slug": "Rolex"}}, {"pk": 87, "model": "bidding.item", "fields": {"retail_price": "78.00", "description": "PRODUCT INFORMATION:\r\nThe simple and spacious Troop Messenger is great for travels or everyday use.\r\nMessenger style cross body bag made of canvas.\r\nHolds your personal technology, a magazine and file folders.\r\nSingle adjustable crossbody strap.

In general, the user shall be liable for all activities that are undertaken using the user account together with the associated password.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n<p>\r\nYambid reserves the right to temporarily or permanently disqualify a user, or disable their account at any time, and at its sole discretion. Users will be disqualified when in the reasonable opinion of Yambids\u2019 member has violated any laws or the rights of third parties. A user will be disqualified if such action will protect the rights of other users, or to prevent unauthorized manipulation or use of Yambid. Examples of such unauthorized usage include (but are not limited to) non-payment of bids, use of unauthorized third-party bidding software or set up of multiple user accounts by the same individual. In case of a breach of these Terms, Yambid reserves the right to withhold deliveries or refunds for bids.\r\n\r\n</p> \r\n<p>\r\nFurthermore, Yambid reserves the right to limit the number of auctions a user may win or the number of his successfully finished auctions at its sole discretion. Please refer to our separate acceptable use policy for additional information.\r\n\r\n</P> \r\n\r\n<h2>3. Bid Purchasing for Online Bidding/Payment/Validity of Bids</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nBidding rights, so-called \u201cbids\u201d, must be purchased and paid for by users prior to online bidding. Bids can be purchased in packages (so-called \u201cBidPacks\u201d) at the currently applicable prices, which can be viewed under \u201cHow to Video\u201d or in the \u201cBuy Bids\u201d link.\r\n\r\n</p> \r\n<p>\r\nPayments can be made by credit/debit card or via payment agents such as PayPal. Should a payment not be honored by a user, a returned payment fee will be charged. The user will be responsible for these fees. Yambid reserves the right to block access to the user\u2019s account until payment in full of the invoice amount, including any fees due to returned payment etc., and to withhold any outstanding deliveries until payment is received in full.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n <p>\r\nPurchase bids or free bids have expiration date, but once a Bid is placed in an auction, it is deducted from the user\u2019s bid account and can no longer be refunded. Refunds will not be issued for Bids placed in an auction. For further information on refunds please see our <b>Refund Policy</b>.\r\n\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>4. Bidding</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nBids can be placed by clicking on the relevant bid buttons.  The Auctioneer is a Yambid team member who assists bidders if they have any questions. To ask an Auctioneer a question about bidding, you must communicate through our built in chat feature.  The user can read about how the Auctioneer operates in the \u201cHow It Works\u201d section. The user is prohibited from using bidding software not authorized by Yambid, and doing so will result in immediate disqualification from use (see clause 2: Eligibility and the Acceptable Use Policy). \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. How the Auctions Work</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWith each bid placed, the price of the item on which the user is bidding increases by the amount specified (one penny). A bid submitted by the user constitutes willingness of a user to enter into a binding contract with Yambid and in the event of a successful finishing of an auction, the claim to receive a purchase offer for the item of the auction under the conditions set out in the related auction. A contract to purchase the item does not come into effect until the auction is finished and the last bidder has followed all the steps as set forth in clause number 6.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEach new bid resets the \u2018remaining time\u2019 for an auction up to, but not above, the displayed countdown reset value (usually 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120 seconds).  For more information, please consult the \u2018Auctioneer\u2019 working at that time. The auction ends when the remaining time reaches zero. The user who was the last to bid then wins the auction. All other bids placed on the item expire and will not be credited back to the user\u2019s account or be eligible for a refund. The last bidder is determined based on the records in Yambid\u2019s database and Yambid\u2019s decision regarding who is the last bidder shall be final (save in the case of manifest error).\r\n\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>6. Acceptance of the Win / Payment</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter an auction has ended, the last bidder (\u201cwinner\u201d) will get a link to fill in his/her information for the delivery process. Here, information such as total price and payment options will be displayed. The user must actively confirm and pay the total price (end price only shipping is free) for the win by following the steps indicated on that page or elsewhere on the website. Once the winner has clicked on the confirmation button the win is accepted. If an auction win has not been confirmed and paid within 21 days of the auction end date, Yambid reserves the right to withdraw the offer to conclude a contract and the winner\u2019s right to pay for and receive delivery of an item will be permanently revoked. All bids placed in that auction expire and are non-refundable. The user must pay the total price when confirming the win. After confirming the win and paying the amount due, the winner will receive a confirmation e-mail.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe item will not be sent to the user until the total price has been paid to Yambid. A similar requirement for delivery is that all bids purchased and used by the user have been properly paid for. Should bids that have already been purchased and used not have been paid for, payments received shall be viewed as payment toward the bids not yet paid for, and we reserve the right to retain the item purchased at auction until all bids and the total price have been paid for in full. Yambid reserves the right to charge the winner reasonable storage charges for items not paid for.\r\nAn invoice containing the auction price and shipping costs will be sent to the user by Yambid once delivery has been arranged. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Returns and Cancellations</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nYambid grants winners the right to cancel an order. This right is unconditional and begins from the moment the contract is concluded. If a user cancels a contract to which the cancellation provisions apply they are entitled to a refund of the auction end price they have paid in relation to the contract even if the goods are not defective in any way. Bids placed on the auction are not eligible for a refund. These cancellation rights end fourteen days after the day on which a winner received the goods or a notification that the goods are ready for collection. \r\nAn exception to the right to cancel is audio or video recordings or computer software that the customer has unsealed. These items are not eligible for return or refund.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf a user wishes to cancel the contract, they must inform Yambid in writing (by letter or email), that they want to cancel within the time period noted above. Cancellations by phone will not be accepted.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<fieldset><legend>\r\nThe following contact details must be used:\r\n</legend>\r\n<p>\r\n    Yambid, LLC.<br/>\r\n    3700 S. Las Vegas Blvd #STE 1176<br/>\r\n    Las Vegas, NV 89109<br/>\r\n    U.S.A.<br/>\r\n<a style=\"color: rgb(42, 148, 209);\" href=\"mailto:info@ibiddjango.com?subject=Yambid user\">info@ibiddjango.com</a>\r\n</p></fieldset>\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to complete a valid cancellation or return, a user must return the received product or products in good condition, such as might be expected from typical testing in a retail store. Costs of postage for returns will be paid by the user (unless goods are found to be faulty). If the user is unable to return the service or product received or only able to return it in part or only in a depreciated condition, he will have to pay compensation to us [the amount refundable will be reduced proportionally], as applicable. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShould Yambid incur additional costs for insufficient postage on the return or for courier shipments and other irregular shipping methods that are over and above postal shipping costs, these costs will be deducted from any payment whatsoever remitted by the customer. Sets/boxes can only be returned in their entirety. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. Delivery</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nUnless otherwise stated, delivery will be made directly from our suppliers or from our warehouse to the address provided by the user. Deliveries are made solely within the 50 states of the United States (explicitly excluding the U.S. sovereign territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Some restrictions or higher shipping costs may apply if the delivery address is in Alaska or Hawaii, please check notifications on the detail pages of the auctions in advance. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDelivery times vary and any delivery time indicated is provided only as a guide and is not guaranteed. Yambid shall be entitled to involve third parties to satisfy its contractual obligations without being required to notify the buyer. Obvious damage to the item from transport or packaging damaged during transport is to be reported to Yambid upon taking delivery.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShould Yambid not be able to deliver the item ordered, Yambid shall be entitled to substitute the item with a comparable replacement product with the same or better features, or provide a refund of the auction end price to the user based upon the user\u2019s preference. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>9. Offsetting / Withholding Payment / Retention of Title</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe user shall only have the right to offset if his or her counterclaims are not disputed by Yambid. The user is not entitled by reason of any alleged minor defect to withhold more than a proportionate amount of the sum due.\r\n\r\n</p> \r\n<p>\r\nThe item delivered shall remain Yambid\u2019s property until payment is received in full of the total price, including for the bids used in the auction. Until such time as payment has been made in full the user undertakes to store the item separately from their other possessions and to insure it. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>10.
